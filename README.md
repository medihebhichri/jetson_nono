smart house
 I just finished this awesome project where I created a smart house system using Jetson Nano. It was a lot of work, but it was totally worth it! One of the coolest things about my system is that it can recognize people's faces. I used advanced algorithms and machine learning to train my system to quickly identify authorized individuals and give them access to my home. It's a really convenient and secure way to control who can come and go from my house. I'm really proud of what I accomplished, and I think it could be a great inspiration for other people who are interested in exploring the world of smart home automation.
